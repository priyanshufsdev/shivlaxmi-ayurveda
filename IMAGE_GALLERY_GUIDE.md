## 🔄 Updating Product Images

### Replace an Image
1. Go to `public/products/`
2. Replace the image file (e.g., `product1-1.jpg`)
3. Keep the same filename
4. Refresh browser - changes appear instantly!

### Add More Images to a Product
1. Open `data/products.ts`
2. Find your product
3. Add more image paths to the `images` array:

```typescript
images: [
  '/products/product1-1.jpg',
  '/products/product1-2.jpg',
  '/products/product1-3.jpg',
  '/products/product1-4.jpg',  // New image
  '/products/product1-5.jpg',  // New image
],
```

4. Upload the new images to `public/products/`
5. The gallery will automatically show all images!

### Change Main/Featured Image
The **first image** in the `images` array is used as the main image on the homepage.

To change it, either:
1. Replace `product1-1.jpg` with your desired image, OR
2. Reorder the array in `data/products.ts`:

```typescript
images: [
  '/products/product1-3.jpg',  // Now this is the main image
  '/products/product1-1.jpg',
  '/products/product1-2.jpg',
],
```
